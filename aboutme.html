HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quickly became my playground, and I started creating small web projects to test my skills and explore the vast world of web development. The satisfaction of seeing lines of code come together to form a functional website is something that still excites me to this day. </p>
    <h3 style="color : Green" > What Drives Me </h3>
